# Contributing to Missile Defense Simulation System

Thank you for considering contributing to the Missile Defense Simulation System! This is a sophisticated distributed simulation that models realistic missile defense scenarios using microservices and event-driven architecture. We welcome contributions from developers interested in distributed systems, physics simulation, and military defense modeling.

## Project Goals

This project aims to create an accurate, real-time simulation of missile defense systems with the following objectives:

- **Realistic Physics**: Accurate modeling of missile trajectories, atmospheric effects, and interception dynamics
- **Distributed Architecture**: Scalable microservices architecture using NATS messaging and PostgreSQL
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-second response times for threat assessment and engagement coordination
- **Comprehensive Modeling**: Realistic representation of radar detection, command & control, and counter-defense systems
- **Educational Value**: Understanding of complex military defense systems and distributed system design

3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (e.g., `feature/improved-physics` or `bugfix/radar-detection`)
4. **Install Docker and Docker Compose** (required for the distributed system)
5. **Start the development environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
6. **Access the web interface** at `http://localhost:8089` to verify everything is working

### Development Workflow

1. **Understand the Architecture**: Familiarize yourself with the microservices and NATS messaging patterns
2. **Make your changes** on your branch
3. **Test locally** using the Docker environment
4. **Write clear and concise commit messages** following conventional commits
5. **Push your branch** to your fork
6. **Create a pull request** against the `main` branch
7. **Describe your changes** in detail, including any physics or architectural implications

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Add docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Use async/await patterns for all I/O operations

### Service Architecture
- Each service should follow the established pattern:
  - `api.py`: FastAPI application and REST endpoints
  - `messaging.py`: Database operations and NATS communication
  - `*_logic.py`: Core business logic (where applicable)
- Maintain separation of concerns between services
- Use dependency injection for database and NATS clients

### Physics and Simulation
- All physics calculations should be based on real-world models
- Document sources for physical constants and equations
- Include unit tests for physics calculations
- Consider performance implications of complex calculations

### Event-Driven Communication
- Use established NATS topic patterns:
  - `simulation.launch`: Missile launch events
  - `missile.position`: Position updates
  - `radar.detection`: Detection events
  - `battery.{callsign}.engage`: Engagement orders
- Include proper error handling for message processing
- Add correlation IDs for tracing across services

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Testing
- Write unit tests for all physics calculations
- Test NATS message handling with mocked clients
- Validate database operations with test data
- Aim for >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing

- Verify real-time performance requirements

### Scenario Testing
- Create realistic test scenarios covering:
  - Single missile attacks
  - Multi-missile salvos
  - Radar detection edge cases
  - Battery engagement coordination
  - System failure recovery

### Performance Testing
- Verify sub-second response times for critical operations
- Test system behavior under high missile load
- Validate memory usage and resource consumption
- Monitor NATS message throughput
